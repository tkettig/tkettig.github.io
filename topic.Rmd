<h3> Hawaiian phonetics </h3> 

While I was pursuing a PhD in the [Department of Linguistics at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/linguistics/), I studied [ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_language) at [Kawaihuelani Center for Hawaiian Language](https://www.kawaihuelani.org/), part of the [Hawaiʻinuiākea School of Hawaiian Knowledge](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/hshk/). I realized that there had been very little linguistic research on Hawaiian pronunciation and decided to focus my doctoral research on the phonetic properties of the language's vowels. I have been measuring the acoustic properties of elders whose voices were recorded in the 1970s-1980s on [Ka Leo Hawaiʻi](https://ulukau.org/kaniaina/?a=cl&cl=CL1&sp=A&ai=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN%7ctxTI%7ctxTA%7ctxCO%7ctxTY%7ctxLA%7ctxKE%7ctxPR%7ctxSG%7ctxTO%7ctxTG%7ctxSM%7ctxTR%7ctxSP%7ctxCT%7ctxET%7ctxHT----------------), a Hawaiian language radio show. Some outputs of this research have included:

<h3> Forensic phonetics </h3>

I conducted postdoctoral research at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/language/) on [Vincent Hughes'](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ddZncLsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Carmen Llamas'](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f47LQuAAAAAJ&hl=en) AHRC-funded project [Humans and Machines: Novel Methods for Assessing Speaker Recognition Performance](https://sites.google.com/york.ac.uk/humans-machines/home?authuser=0). We developed a bespoke computer game that elicits judgments of voice similarity in pairs of voices with various UK regional accents. We wanted to explore what factors affect sameness judgments in humans (for instance, jurors in trials involving voice-matching evidence) and we wanted to compare their outputs
