abstract = "This essay investigates the history of the English low vowel space from its earliest roots to present-day varieties, observing how Labov’s (1994, 2010) vowel shifting framework accounts for changes ranging from the hypothetical to those that can be observed and tested today in fine phonetic detail. Starting with the reconstructed low vowels of Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Germanic, certain identifiable changes may have involved switches in vowels’ relative peripherality according to Labov’s main shifting and exit principles. In attested forms of Old English and Middle English, these principles also account for the cycling of various vowel classes through the [æ~a~ɑ~ɒ] space. Since Early Modern English, short /æ/ has lengthened in many present-day varieties, resulting in phonemic BATH-TRAP splits in Southern England and the Northeast United States as well as other phonetically-conditioned patterns across North America. The wholesale lengthening of BATH/TRAP has also propelled the Northern Cities Shift, in which the fronting/lowering of LOT/FATHER and THOUGHT seemingly contradict Labov’s original unidirectional principles; Labov (1994) posits a third shifting principle governing front-back movements to account for this. The ongoing Canadian Shift, in which /ɛ/ and /æ/ lower and retract in Canadian English, has been observed and described in several locales and across successive generations, revealing the trajectory of /æ/ and /ɛ/ through comparable apparent-time studies. A close consideration of this shift reveals that it can only conform to the shifting principles if /æ/ is defined phonologically as non-peripheral despite its phonetically peripheral location in F1/F2 space. Though Labov (2010) explicitly endorses defining peripherality on phonetic grounds, his stipulation that the boundary between peripheral and non-peripheral tracks is absent in the low vowel space leaves open the possibility of a phonetically motivated account of peripherality based on durational cues, an underexplored aspect of Canadian English."
