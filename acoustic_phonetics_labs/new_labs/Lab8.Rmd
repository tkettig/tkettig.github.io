### __Goal of Lab 8:__
<font size= "4.5"> In this lab, we are going to explore the acoustic correlates of another class of sonorants, the __nasals__ [m n ŋ]. Like other sonorants, nasals are:  

+	similar to vowels in that they have formants
+ different from vowels in that they are generally lower amplitude (and behave as consonants phonologically), and have a more complex spectral composition. </font>

#### __SOUND FILE__
Find the file __"Lab8_nasals.wav"__ on eClass and download it.

| _File name_          | _Sounds_ |
|:--------------------:|:------------------:|
|Lab8_nasals.wav       |ama, ana, aŋa       |

In this lab, you should focus on what is common between __all three__ nasals.

***

#### __INSTRUCTIONS__

1. Open the file __"Lab8_nasals.wav"__. Follow the instructions below to fill in Table 8.1 on the acoustic correlates of different nasals.

<br>

<u> A. Nasal F1 Values </u>

If you can't remember how to measure formants, refer back to Lab 4.

* In Table 8.1, note down F1 for each nasal, as measured in the centre of the nasal.

<u> B. Spectral slice </u>

* Create spectral slices for each nasal and for one example of [a], from a 30ms selection for each sound (see Lab 7 for how to take a spectral slice). Take a screenshot of each spectral slice and paste them into your lab report document. Be sure to give each spectral slice an appropriate title.

<u> C. Waveform </u>

* Nasals have very distinctive waveforms. To see this, zoom in on 10 or so cycles of each nasal. Take a screenshot of the visible waveform of one of the nasals and paste it into your lab report. Make sure to give the waveform an appropriate title. Now do the same with an equivalent portion of one of the [a] vowels, and also paste that into your lab with an appropriate title.

<u> D. Antiformants </u>

Antiformants are the _opposite_ of formants – they are bands of frequencies that are actively damped rather than amplified (we’ll talk about this in class). They show up on the spectrogram as bands of white, i.e. bands of ‘silence’ at particular frequencies (Figure 8.2). For finding antiformants, you may find it easier to get rid of the formant tracking. You may also see them in the spectral slice as deep "valleys" in the spectrum (Figure 8.3). They can be difficult to see, so don’t worry if their measurement seems hard. 

* Again, in Table 8.1, note down the centre frequency of A1 (Antiformant 1), A2, and A3 for each nasal, as measured in the centre of the nasal.

__Q1:__ Look at your measurements of F1 for the three nasals. Do these measurements vary across different places of articulation?

__Q2:__ Compare the spectral slices of the nasals vs. [a] – do you see any overall differences between the nasals on the one hand and [a] on the other? (Relate this to your answer to Q1.)

__Q3:__ How does the shape of the waveform of the nasals differ from that of [a]? What causes this pattern? (Relate this to Q1 and Q2 above.)

__Q4:__ Are there any systematic patterns across nasals in terms of antiformants? Is there one antiformant with a similar frequency for all places of articulation?

<br>

__Q5:__ Provide a reference and very brief summary of one academic paper that uses the methods covered in this lab.
