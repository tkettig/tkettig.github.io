# Biography

Hello! Welcome to my humble internet abode. I'm Thomas.
 
I study how language varies and changes through space and time. Some of my research has aimed to understand how and why the vowel sounds of English in particular change from one generation of speakers to the next. This means that my work touches on issues in theoretical phonology, historical linguistics, and the nitty-gritty of articulatory and acoustic phonetics.
 
I'm from Jackson Heights, a neighborhood in New York City's borough of Queens. I speak English, French, Finnish, German, and Hawaiian and have a reading knowledge of Yiddish and Latin.
